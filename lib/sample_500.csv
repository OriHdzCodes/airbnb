FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa.

Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in (Website hidden by Airbnb) kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

我今年 29歲，在UA修語言及文學，同時在安特衛普打工。我喜歡每一個城市的熱鬧氛圍，不管是音樂節，公園演唱會，時尚購物，戲劇表演，博物館，或在市中心散步，我都盡可能找機會品嘗。另外我很樂於交朋友，不管是提供舒適的空間給旅遊愛好者，傳達關於我的城市的資訊，或無壓力的互動，我很理解也能夠發揮Airbnb想表達的精神，畢竟非凡的旅遊方式和與當地人交集是我們的共同點。
我曾去舊金山與兒時的朋友居住，參與過墨西哥的多重文化案子，與他人居住的城市包含柏林，巴拉多利德，巴塞羅那，維也納，等等。在家時我也儘量保持旅遊的心態。我最愛的荷蘭作家『Godfriend Bomans』曾說:『生活的祕訣在於旅遊時也感受到家。』我希望來這裡的客人都有這樣的感受，並期待很快能歡迎您來安特衛普。

I am Frà, short for Francesca, an Italian but I moved to Belgium 10 years ago to be with Dominique, my Flemish husband, with whom I have two little girls. We are an eclectic couple, joined by many small aspects that make our cultural diversity very interesting.
I like to cook, sports and I enjoy my social life. I love the sea and the sun.
I think Antwerp is a funny and interesting city, where you can really find anything what you like on every single moment. 

 “La casa di frà” è nata dal desiderio di conoscere persone che viaggiano alla scoperta di luoghi e di culture diverse. 
Sono Frà, abbreviazione di Francesca, un’italiana che vive in Belgio da 10 anni e sposata con un fiammingo, Dominique, e abbiamo due bambine. Siamo una coppia eclettica,  le nostre diversita' culturali rendono affascinante e interessante la nostra vita. 
Mi piace cucinare, fare sport e chiacchierare con gli amici e conoscerne di nuovi. Amo il mare e il sole.

In the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte had the first two docks excavated for an important naval base. This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the « Eilandje » is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization ""City on the River"" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de Solà-Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 René Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.
Enjoy your time in Antwerp, they say it's the city of diamonds. 
But for me it's the people who shine :)
Leave a note, a comment or better...a story before you leave. 
I love stories.
